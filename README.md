## Basics

Assuming you know why you need TypeScript, let's get down to it.
You need, of course, NodeJs installed for this.

run `npm install typescript --save-dev` to install TS to your local project, or you can install globally as well if that is what you want.

- The extension is .ts
- `compile` by running `npm tsc <filname>`
- you just add your general `script` tag to your `index.html` file.
- compiles a JS file with the same name. That is what you add to your `html` file.
- `npm tsc <filename> --w` will constantly watch for any changes you made. handy!
